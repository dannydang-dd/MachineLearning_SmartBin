Senior Project

The Smart Bin project aims to revolutionize waste management by integrating advanced technologies such as embedded systems, machine learning, and hardware design. The primary objective is to create an intelligent waste bin capable of distinguishing between recyclable and non-recyclable waste, thereby promoting efficient waste sorting and recycling practices.
The Smart Bin will be equipped with sensors, cameras, and some sort of grabbing tool to detect  and sort various types 	of waste. The core innovation lies in its machine learning capability, which will be trained to identify different waste types, including plastic bottles, aluminum, cardboard, and compostable materials. This identification process will be based on specific characteristics of the waste, such as size, shape, color, and material composition. The Smart Bin prototype will be limited on specific items such as a water battle, aluminum soda can, cardboard box, and compost banana peel. 
Once the waste is identified, the Smart Bin will use its grabbing tools to sort the waste into separate compartments for recyclables and non-recyclables. This automated sorting process not only reduces the manual labor involved in waste management but also increases the efficiency and accuracy of recycling.
